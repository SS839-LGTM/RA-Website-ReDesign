                <p>The Roads Authority offers annual bursaries to Namibian nationals pursuing full-time tertiary studies in fields required by the organisation.</p>

                <h2>Who should apply</h2>
                <p>Namibian nationals who meet the entry requirements of their chosen tertiary institution and the course of study (e.g., civil engineering, IT, or related disciplines).</p>

                <h2>Bursary benefits</h2>
